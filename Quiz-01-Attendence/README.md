This is a **React Native Attendance App** built using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).  
It allows users to mark and track attendance for classes or events — a perfect starter app for mobile app practice.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure your environment is set up for React Native development.  
> Follow the official [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide.

---

## Step 1: Start Metro Bundler

Metro is the JavaScript bundler for React Native. Run this from the root of your project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

---

## Step 2: Build and Run the App

With Metro running, open another terminal and run the app on your device or emulator.

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

> First-time setup (CocoaPods):

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```

Then run:

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

Your app should launch in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or a connected device.

> You can also build and run the app directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

---

## Step 3: Modify Your App

Open `App.tsx` in your editor and make changes.  
**Fast Refresh** will automatically update the app as you save changes.

- **Android:** Double-press <kbd>R</kbd> or use **Dev Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>).  
- **iOS:** Press <kbd>R</kbd> in the Simulator.
